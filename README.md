# Hamiltonian Paths on grid graphs

The Hamiltonian Path problem on Grid graph is a problem at the frontier of Geometry, Graph Theory. It mixes together knowledge from Mathematics and Computer Sciences.

The current project uses Python to manipulate instances of the problem. It integrate visualisation tools, modelizations and algorithms to enable active research on this problem.
